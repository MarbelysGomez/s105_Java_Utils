# Prerequisites:
Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is properly installed and configured on your computer to execute this program.

## Running the Program:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal on your computer.

2. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you stored the cloned repository (s105_Java_Utils).

3. Compilation:
Compile the Java files using the javac command. Ensure to include the package name when specifying file paths: 

```sh
javac s105_Java_Utils\S105_N1exercise3\DirectoryTxt.java s105_Java_Utils\S105_N1exercise3\Main.java
```

4. Running the Program:
After successful compilation, execute the program using the java command. Be sure to include the package name when specifying file paths:

java -cp . s105_Java_Utils.S105_N1exercise3.Main "directory_name"

Replace directory_name with the actual path of the directory you want to list.

5. Viewing the content of output.txt:

```sh
type output.txt
```


These steps will compile and execute the Java program within the s105_Java_Utils directory. Adjust the paths accordingly based on your specific environment.
